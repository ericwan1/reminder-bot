# reminder-bot

Making a reminder bot to notiify people of any events that may soon occur 

### Goal

We want to create a script that can be triggered automatically and manually. This script will remind people through the following platforms:

- Text 
- Groupme

We will determine when this script will fire by checking a Google Calendar for a specific event. This script will fire off a week before, 48 hours before, the morning of, an hour before, and ten minutes before the event starts.
